You are generating a single-page portfolio website for a vibecode / no-code developer.

IMPORTANT:
- Use semantic HTML
- Use pure CSS only (NO Tailwind, Bootstrap, or frameworks)
- Minimal JavaScript (tabs, slider only)
- Mobile-first layout
- Clean, modern, professional UI
- Structure the code so it can be easily connected to a backend later
- Assume the developer’s personal photo will be added manually (local image file)

PAGE STRUCTURE:

1. HERO SECTION
- Two-column layout on desktop, single-column on mobile
- Left side:
  - H1 title: “VibeCode / No-Code Developer”
  - Short subtitle about fast MVP, automation, AI
  - Short bullet list (2–3 points)
  - 2 CTA buttons:
    - “View Projects”
    - “Contact Me”
- Right side:
  - Developer photo (img tag)
  - Photo requirements:
    - Local image (e.g. /assets/profile.jpg)
    - Rounded or circular shape
    - Max width constraint
    - Soft shadow
    - Subtle hover effect (scale or shadow)
- Photo must not be a background image — use <img> for accessibility

2. SKILLS / STACK SECTION
- Tabs interface:
  - No-code
  - AI / API
  - Automation
- Inside each tab: badges or small cards with tools
  (Lovable, Make, n8n, Zapier, OpenAI API, Cursor, Telegram Bots)

3. PROJECTS SECTION (IMPORTANT)
- Display projects as cards in a CSS Grid
- Each project card contains:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - Stack as tags/badges
- Add hover animation:
  - transform: translateY(-6px)
  - box-shadow increase
  - transition 0.3s ease
- Assume project data will later come from projects.json or API

4. SERVICES SECTION
- Cards layout
- Each service card:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - CTA button “Discuss”
- Data structure should be replaceable by services.json

5. TESTIMONIALS SECTION
- Simple slider or horizontal scroll
- Cards with text + author

6. CONTACT SECTION
- Simple contact form:
  - name
  - email
  - message
- Use <form method="POST">
- Proper name attributes
- Ready for backend integration

STYLING REQUIREMENTS:
- CSS Variables (:root)
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Rounded cards
- Soft shadows
- Hover animations on cards, buttons, and photo
- Consistent spacing and typography
- No external UI libraries

FILES STRUCTURE:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js (optional, minimal)
- /assets/profile.jpg (placeholder path for developer photo)

GOAL:
Generate clean, readable frontend code suitable for further backend development in Cursor and easy replacement of static data with API responses.
